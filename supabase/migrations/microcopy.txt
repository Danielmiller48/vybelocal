# VybeLocal Microcopy Playbook — Refresh (v2025-08)

**Purpose:** give Cursor/AI an exact voice + ready-to-paste strings for VybeLocal across app, host tools, payments, and marketing. Use this as the *single source of truth*.

---

## 1) Brand essence (keep this in mind for every line)

* **Mission:** Help people find each other in the real world. No feed. No clout. Just vibes that turn into plans.
* **Tone:** **Grounded, concise, humane, quietly confident.**
* **Never:** campy hype, influencer slang, or algorithm talk (e.g., “trending,” “fam,” “you’re on fire”).
* **Taglines:**

  * Primary: **Tap in to real.**
  * Secondary (long-form/press): **Where Real Beats Reel.**
* **Day/Night duality:**

  * **Day:** energetic, welcoming, practical.
  * **Night:** moody, focused, safety-forward.

### Voice sliders (set before writing)

* Formality: 3/10 (plain speech over corporate).
* Energy: day 6/10 · night 4/10.
* Warmth: 6/10 (friendly, not gushy).
* Authority: 7/10 (clear directions, low jargon).

---

## 2) Lexicon (approved words)

* **Vybe** (event), **Circle** (group), **Vybemap** (map), **RSVP**, **Host**, **Door tools**, **Settlement report**, **Patron** (support tier), **Comp list**, **Check-in** (QR).
* **Categories:** Chill, Creative, Active, Hype.
* **Payments:** platform fee, refund window, payout, KYB.

**Avoid:** feed, trending, algorithm, viral, fam, squad, lit, fuego.

---

## 3) Style rules (Cursor-ready)

1. **Short first.** Aim 2–8 words for UI; 8–16 words for helper text.
2. **One thought per line.**
3. **Lead with the action.** (“RSVP now”, “Create a Vybe”).
4. **Blame the system, not the user.** (“We couldn’t save that. Try again.”)
5. **No exclamation unless safety.**
6. **Sentence case.** Title Case only for proper nouns.
7. **Numbers:** use digits (2, 30). Time in **12‑hour** with am/pm.
8. **Clarity over clever.** Save poetry for promos.

## 4) Button & CTA patterns

* **Primary:** RSVP now · Host a Vybe · Create event · Save changes · Continue
* **Secondary:** Preview · Edit details · Learn more · View map

## 14) Prompt template for Cursor/LLMs

> **You are VybeLocal’s microcopy writer.** Write in a grounded, concise, humane voice. Avoid hype and slang. Prefer 2–8 words for UI. Use the brand lexicon (Vybe, Circle, Vybemap, RSVP). Do not mention feeds or algorithms. Use the taglines “Tap in to real.” (primary) and “Where Real Beats Reel.” (secondary) only when appropriate. Provide 3 variants, each under the character limits below. If the ask is marketing, you may be a little more lyrical; in‑product strings must stay literal and actionable.

**Return format:** plain text with bullet list of options. No explanations.

**Character limits:** buttons ≤ 20, toasts ≤ 60, helper ≤ 90.

---

## 15) QA checklist (before shipping copy)

* Is the first word an action?
* Can this be 20% shorter?
* Is there a clear next step?
* Would this read cleanly on a 5” screen?
* Does it align with **Tap in to real**?

---

### Appendix — Safety pipeline strings

* **Warning:** **Keep it respectful.** One more issue may pause your account.
* **24h lock:** **Take a beat.** Your account is locked for 24 hours.
* **Final ban:** **We’re not a match.** Your account is permanently closed.

### Appendix — Payments transparency

* **Payouts:** **Payouts run 24h after your event ends.**
* **Fees:** **Hosts keep 100%. Guests pay a small fee.**
* **Receipts:** **We’ll email a receipt and your RSVP.**
